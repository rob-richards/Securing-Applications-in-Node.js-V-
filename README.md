## About the Video Course
Everyone agrees that web application security is very important but there are very few to take it seriously. There have been lots of high-profile instances of websites having their password databases exposed to the World (e.g. Ashley Madison and Adobe). You donâ€™t want the application you are building to be the next big security horror story. This course will get you up-to-speed on the key attack vectors, quickly covering issues such as cross-site scripting, CSRF, and SQL injection. It will provide you with clear, practical approaches to mitigating these problems. It will show you how to implement OAuth and two-factor authentication for the additional protection of users who need it. Further, we will delve into the critical process of adding secured, well-thought-out authentication and authorization to a Node.js application. After completing this course, you should be confident in your ability to make an application secure with Node.js and keep your data protected.
